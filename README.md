# Minesweeper

This is a classic game of Minesweeper (yes, the one you know from way back in those win95 days). I'm using it as an opportunity to learn new languages & frameworks. In particular, the backend for this game will be done with Go, using any tools I find interesting along the way, and a frontend with Vue.
I'll be setting myself a deadline: to complete this over the weekend, with whatever time I find in between. This will be a good indicator to myself of the learning curve of the Go ecosystem, and it's ease of use.

## Short term plans

- Template Go API project, with a featured framework that includes auto generating docs (Swagger, or Swagger like)
- Template Vue project
- Deploy to AWS
- Setup pipelines (might do with github actions instead of aws pipelines, easier to setup)
- Basic API endpoints to create game (store game matrix in db)
- Basic API endpoints to play the game
- Basic UI to visualize the game board and interact with the backend
- User auth workflow
- Testing (normally this'd be much higher up the list, but this is a prototype)
